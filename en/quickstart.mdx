## Step 1: Create your project

Projects allow you to organize your agents and automations by business domain.

  <Step title="Access the dashboard">
    Log in to your [Scalt dashboard](https://app.scalt.ai)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new project">
    Click **"New project"** and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Marketing Automation" or "Customer Support")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings">
    Set basic parameters: name, description, and tags
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>

## Step 2: Create your first agent with Scalt Assistant

Scalt Assistant allows you to create agents simply by describing what you want to automate.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Scalt Assistant">
    In your project, click **"Assistant"** tab in the left sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your need">
    Simply express what you want to automate, for example:
    
    ```
    "Create an agent that monitors my emails, identifies urgent customer 
    requests and automatically creates tickets in our support system"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assistant generates your agent">
    Scalt Assistant analyzes your request and automatically generates:
    - The agent configuration
    - Ask you to add the necessary tools
    - Ask you to add the necessary documents
    - Ask you to add the necessary instructions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup>

```text Simple prompt example
Create an agent that analyzes my daily sales and sends me a summary every morning
```

```text Advanced prompt example
Create an agent that:
1. Retrieves new leads from HubSpot
2. Enriches data with LinkedIn
3. Scores leads according to our criteria
4. Sends the best leads to the sales team via Slack
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Configure your agent

Once your agent is created, customize it according to your needs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plug" title="Connect your tools">
    Add necessary integrations:
    - **Tools**: Connect your favorite applications
    - **APIs**: Integrate your custom APIs by adding a MCP connector
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="sliders" title="Adjust settings">
    Customize your agent's behavior:
    - **AI Model**: Choose between GPT-4, Claude, Mistral...
    - **Temperature**: Adjust response creativity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="book" title="Enrich the knowledge base">
    Give context to your agent:
    - **Instructions**: Define specific instructions for your agent
    - **Documents**: Upload knowledge files for your agent (PDF, Word, Excel)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4: Test in the Playground

Before deploying, test your agent in a secure environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Simulate scenarios">
    Test different use cases to verify your agent's behavior
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze results">
    Examine tool calls, and generated responses
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate if necessary">
    Adjust the configuration until you get the desired behavior
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Always test your agent in the Playground before deploying to production to avoid costly errors.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Launch your agent

Once satisfied with testing, deploy your agent.

    To launch a task immediately:
    
    1. Click **"Execute now"**
    2. Provide input parameters if necessary
    3. Follow real-time execution
