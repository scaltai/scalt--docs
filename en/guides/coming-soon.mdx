## Agent Orchestration (Magentic)

### What is agent orchestration?

**Agent orchestration** allows you to create **agent teams** that collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. Each agent has its specialized role, and together they form an intelligent and coordinated system.

<Info>
  **Powered by Magentic**: We use the Magentic framework for multi-agent orchestration, enabling intelligent and autonomous coordination.
</Info>

### Why orchestration?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Complex tasks">
    Some tasks require multiple skills:
    
    **Example: Product launch**
    - **Marketing Agent**: Creates content and visuals
    - **Social Media Agent**: Schedules posts
    - **Analytics Agent**: Tracks performance
    - **CRM Agent**: Updates customer segments
    - **Orchestrator**: Coordinates everything
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Specialization">
    Each agent excels in its domain:
    
    - **Writer Agent**: Optimized copywriting
    - **Translator Agent**: Native multilingual
    - **SEO Agent**: Search engine optimization
    - **Designer Agent**: Image generation
    
    Together, they produce superior quality content.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Scalability">
    Adapt number of agents according to load:
    
    - **Normal traffic**: 1 support agent
    - **Activity peak**: 5 agents in parallel
    - **Automatic**: Scale up/down as needed
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Orchestration modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sequential">
    Agents execute one after another (try it in beta).
    
    ```yaml
    orchestration:
      mode: "sequential"
      agents:
        - id: "data-collector"
          output: "raw_data"
        
        - id: "data-analyzer"
          input: "${raw_data}"
          output: "insights"
        
        - id: "report-generator"
          input: "${insights}"
          output: "final_report"
    ```
    
    **Use cases**: Linear processes with strong dependencies
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Parallel">
    Multiple agents execute simultaneously.
    
    ```yaml
    orchestration:
      mode: "parallel"
      agents:
        - id: "sentiment-analyzer"
        - id: "keyword-extractor"
        - id: "entity-recognition"
      
      aggregation:
        agent: "result-merger"
        strategy: "combine_all"
    ```
    
    **Use cases**: Independent analyses, massive processing
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Autonomous (Magentic)">
    Agents decide coordination themselves.
    
    ```yaml
    orchestration:
      mode: "autonomous"
      goal: "Analyze customer satisfaction and propose improvements"
      
      available_agents:
        - "data-fetcher"
        - "sentiment-analyzer"
        - "trend-detector"
        - "recommendation-engine"
        - "report-writer"
      
      constraints:
        max_iterations: 10
        budget: 5.0  # credits
        timeout: 300  # seconds
    ```
    
    **Use cases**: Open problems, creative exploration
  </Tab>
