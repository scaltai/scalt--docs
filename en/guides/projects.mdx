## Introduction

Projects in Scalt allow you to organize your agents, automations, and resources in a structured way. Each project typically represents a business domain, department, or specific use case.

<Info>
  **Best practice**: Create one project per department (Marketing, Sales, Support) or per use case (Lead Generation, Customer Success, Reporting).

- By status: "production", "test", "development"
- By frequency: "real-time", "daily", "weekly"
```

## Share resources between agents

### Shared knowledge base

All agents in a project can access the shared knowledge base:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload documents">
    In **"Knowledge base"**, add your files (PDF, Word, Excel, CSV...)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize by categories">
    Create thematic folders (Products, Processes, Customers...)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic indexing">
    Scalt automatically indexes your documents for agent access
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Shared tools

Configure once, use everywhere:

- **Integrations**: Connect Slack, Gmail, CRM once
- **Custom MCPs**: Define your endpoints at project level
- **Webhooks**: Receive notifications for all agents

  </Step>

## Archive or delete a project

### Archive a project

Archiving allows you to keep data while deactivating the project:

- Agents no longer execute
