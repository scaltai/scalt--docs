## Write a good prompt

### Basic principles

A good prompt for Scalt Assistant should be:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clear" icon="lightbulb">
    Clearly express the agent's objective
  </Card>
  <Card title="Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Specify the actions to perform
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contextual" icon="book">
    Give the necessary business context
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complete" icon="list-check">
    Include triggers and expected results
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended structure

Use this structure for better results:

```text
[OBJECTIVE]: What should the agent do?
[TRIGGER]: When should it act?
[ACTIONS]: What steps should it follow?
[RESULT]: What is the expected deliverable?
```

## Prompt examples

### Example 1: Customer support agent

<CodeGroup>

```text Basic prompt
Create an agent that responds to customer support emails
```

```text Optimized prompt
OBJECTIVE: Automate responses to customer support requests

TRIGGER: Every time an email arrives at support@company.com

ACTIONS:
1. Analyze email content
2. Identify request type (technical, billing, other)
3. Search our knowledge base
4. Generate appropriate response
5. If request is complex, create ticket and alert team

RESULT: 
- Response email sent to customer
- Ticket created in Zendesk if necessary
- Slack notification for urgent cases
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  The more detailed your prompt, the more accurate and effective the generated agent will be.

  - Test thoroughly before deploying to production.
  - Agents generate costs (Scalt credits + third-party APIs).
</Warning>
